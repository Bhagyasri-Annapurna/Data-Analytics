# **Tata-Data-Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights**

## **Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario**
To prepare for your meeting, you need to draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation.
For this task, you are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively.
You’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.
Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.
Submit your eight questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO) in the text submission box below. 

## **Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals**
In this task, you will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.
You will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, these are available in the resources below. These resources will help you get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for your data. Each question will contain a unique scenario and you will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.
To complete this task, answer the multiple-choice quiz. Start the quiz by clicking ‘Start your quiz’ below. Please note there are 5 multiple choice questions to complete in this task. Please be patient as each question loads.

## **Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals**
In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals and we’ve provided the data in the resources below. 
Both Power BI and Tableau have free trials that can be accessed in order to complete this task. You can find a resource below that directs you how to download these free trials.  
Data cleanup  
Before you can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.  
Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit  
Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0  
Please note that in order to apply the checks that have been mentioned above, you would need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data from analysis. You can also use data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data. Both these methods are provided in the resources. Once this is done, the data will be good to be used for further analysis. Please note that this data should be cleaned up before attempting any question.  
Create each visual on a separate tab with the name of the tab displaying the question number. Once the visuals are created, save the files and upload them below. 

## **Task 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis**
Develop a script and record a video presenting your findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals you created in the previous tasks.
You can use your work or the model answer from the previous task to develop your presentation.
When writing your script, you should speak about your entire process, including the initial data load and clean-up steps so that your leaders know you’ve done your due diligence in providing error-free analysis. 
Data analysis provides heaps of information but remember to focus on the information that is most important to your leaders.
Your video should be approximately 5 minutes in length. You can record your video in the browser or upload a video from your device below.
Remember, this is not just a read out of your visuals, you’re presenting to the CEO and CMO and need to provide context for each scenario and how it relates to their questioning. 
You do not need to submit your script or talking points for this deliverable.
